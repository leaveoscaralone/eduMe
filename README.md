# Task 
> Implement  a number-to-word list converter with a **Node backend** and **React/Redux frontend**.
> The backend should provide a rest endpoint that converts a given numeric string into a list of corresponding words in the style of **T9 or Phonewords**.
- For example, given the input **23** the output should be: **ad, ae, af, bd, be, bf, cd, ce, cf**.
> The frontend should allow the user to *enter a number*, query the backend for the corresponding expansions, and display them.
